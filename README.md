# LowPri

LowPri is a personal Scrapper app that check Items in online stores (right now just [CyberPuerta](https://www.cyberpuerta.mx)), returning essential information about an specific item scrapped.

## Notes

Right now it just scrap the item info.

This first iteration is a test for Heroku deployment.


Heroku and Puppeteer gave me a little bit problem at the beginning, if you are trying to deploy an app with the same setup, check this article [Running Puppeteer on Heroku](https://dev.to/ziv/running-puppeteer-on-heroku-free-tier-e7b)
